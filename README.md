S.I.D. Technologies

The project owner commutes to Santa Cruz from Los Altos on mornings she has class: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Mondays and Fridays, she works. This forces our team to hold scrum meetings through a videochat most days making a physical burnup chart basically useless. Inspired by our inability to find a good online scrum burnup chart template, S.I.D. Technologies aims to create an app with a fully integrated and color-coded scrum system that is affordable and user-friendly.

About the name: S.I.D. is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase, Semel In Die, which means "once a day", a reference to the scrum meetings that are supposed to happen once a day. But also, Scrum Is Dope.
